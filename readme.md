# Twitter Bootstrap 2.0 Demo

This demo application was created for the [DFW CFML User Group](http://dfwcfml.org/)'s February 2012 meeting on [Twitter Bootstrap](https://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) by [Steve Good](http://stevegood.org/).  Version 2.0 of the Bootstrap framework was used as well as version 2.0.1 of the [FW/1](https://github.com/seancorfield/fw1) CFML framework.
